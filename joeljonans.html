<p style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid gray;width: 400px;">A series of events occurred over the Holy Week which left many people challenged.<br>
     These Controversial situations have brought many questions among people.
 Mataki Joel and Wakeda Jonan as great twin brothers showed a novel (Unusual) incident during the MEGA BURST party on Holy Thursday.  
This happened when Wakeda Jonan vowed not to allow his brother M. Joel to eat anything at the party. W. Jeol grabbed all the refreshments that were given to his brother and instead gave them other people. The incident worsened when it reached time for meals as he stopped all the chefs from serving food to his brother who then left the party due to this harassment. Because of too much hunger and consequences, his brother resorted to eating chapati with beans at his home.

<p>When asked about this situation Wakeda replied and that” my brother is a braggart person who thinks his club is the biggest in the world. He made lots of noise about his team which annoyed me. I can't be with him anymore”
However, Mataki claims that his brother is just bias upon my club’s performance in the champions league. I love my young brother and he loves me. This incident is not good but l will talk to him later.
